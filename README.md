🏆 Silent Auction Bidding System
This is a simple Python console application that simulates a silent auction. Users can place their bids, and at the end, the program announces the highest bidder.

📜 Features
ASCII art for fun auction vibe 🖼️

Accepts multiple bids from different users

Clears the screen between bidders (emulated by printing newlines)

Determines and displays the winner with the highest bid

💻 How It Works
The program starts with a fun ASCII art banner.

Users are prompted to enter their name and bid.

The system continues to collect bids until no more participants.

Once bidding ends, it announces the winner with the highest bid.

🧠 Sample Code
python
Copy
Edit
def find_highest_bidder(biding_dictionary):
    winner = ""
    highest_bid = 0
    for bidder in biding_dictionary:
        bid_amount = biding_dictionary[bidder]
        if bid_amount > highest_bid:
            highest_bid = bid_amount
            winner = bidder
    print(f"The winner is {winner} with a bid of $ {highest_bid}")
📦 Requirements

🛠️ Customization Ideas
Add a secret auction mode where bids are not shown to other users.

Automatically clear the terminal screen instead of printing \n * 100.

Store the results in a file or database.

Add input validation and error handling.
